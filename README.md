# C++ Programming Language Course

This repository contains the code exercises from the first programming language course I took. The exercises are based on the course "Algoritmos e Lógica de Programação - O Curso COMPLETO". I completed all the exercises without watching the solution videos.

## Overview

The repository is organized into multiple directories, each representing a different exercise or topic covered in the course. Each directory contains C++ source files that solve specific problems or demonstrate particular programming concepts.

## Structure

- `Above diagonal - C++/`: Exercises related to matrix diagonal elements.
- `Ages - C++/`: Exercises related to age calculations.
- `Approved students - C++/`: Exercises related to student grade validation.
- `Area - C++/`: Exercises related to area calculations.
- `Average evens - C++/`: Exercises related to calculating the average of even numbers.
- `Bhaskara - C++/`: Exercises related to solving quadratic equations using the Bhaskara formula.
